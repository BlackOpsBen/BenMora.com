When I first heard about what a "game jam" was from watching a GMTK video, I fell in love. I desperately wanted to try one. I spent all my free time learning game development, and in February of 2020, I created (my first game)[https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-47-internet/rate/565834] in 72 hours, and got 3rd place overall out of 54 entries!

Head over to my (itch.io page)[https://blackopsben.itch.io/] to play all of my games!
